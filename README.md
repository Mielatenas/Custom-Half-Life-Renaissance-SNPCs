# Custom Half-Life Renaissance SNPCs
Source engine mixed with HL1 SNPCs, close to Black Mesa but still HL1, the kind you'd expect in a customized Half-life server made for Vj Base.
A few npcs that were once fully functional but got unable to live by the past of time, took inspiration on Silverlan's old Renaissance pack that had Frostsquid and Devilsquid really on bad shape and updated them, compatible in your npc collection.    
Items may change in the future since is planned to be independent.
